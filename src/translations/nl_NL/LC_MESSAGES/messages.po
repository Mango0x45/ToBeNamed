msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Coin roll hunting is a popular method of coin collecting in which you "

"through to find new additions to your collection.  Once you’ve searched "
"through all your coins, you will typically deposit your left over coins at "
"the bank and withdrawal new coins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This type of coin collecting is often called ‘Coin Roll Hunting’ due to the "
"fact that coins are often withdrawn in paper-wrapped rolls.  You may however "
"find that your coins come in plastic bags instead (common in countries like "
"Ireland)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on your bank and branch, the process of obtaining coins may differ."
"  Some banks require you speak to a teller, others have coin machines.  Some "
"banks may also require that you are a customer or even to have a business "
"account.  If you aren’t sure about if you can get coins we suggest you "
"contact your bank, although further down this page we also have information "
"about the withdrawal of coins in various countries and major banks."

msgid "Getting Started"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get started with coin roll hunting you should first contact your bank or "
"check their website to find details regarding coin withdrawal.  You will then"
" typically need to go to the bank to pick up your coins.  Depending on your "

"can pick up your coins from the banks tellers.  You will also often need to "
"pay a small fee for each roll, although some banks don’t charge fees."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also important to find details regarding the deposit of coins. "
"Depositing coins often also requires the payment of a fee — one which is "
"typically more expensive than the withdrawal fees.  If depositing your coins "
"is too expensive you can always exchange your left over coins at shops for "
"banknotes.  It is often cheaper (or even free) to deposit banknotes."

msgid "Coin Flips"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Coin flips, also known as ‘2x2’ flips by some Americans are small cardboard "
"flips with a plastic covered hole in the middle for viewing.  Most coin flips"
" are stapled, meaning you put your coin in the flip and staple it shut. These"
" kinds of flips are very cheap, and you can buy stacks of a few hundred for "
"only a few euros.  If you don’t like the staples though, you can also buy "
"adhesive-flips that glue themselves shut.  These flips are more expensive, "
"but also look better than their stapled equivalents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Coin slips are also pretty space efficient, and can be easily stacked in "
"boxes for compact storage.  Many collectors also like to write notes about "
"their coins on the flips.  There also exist special sheets for coin albums "
"that allow you to put in flipped coins, but this is more expensive and less "
"space-efficient than simply using flips or an album without flips."

msgid "What is Vending Machine Hunting?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"‘Vending machine hunting’ is a strategy of collecting coins whereby you "
"continuously insert coins into a vending machine and cancel the transaction "
"by pressing the return button.  When returning your coins to you, you will "
"often get different coins from the ones you put in, and you can repeat this "
"process until you’ve searched through every coin in the machine."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Test Coins"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, you want to make sure the vending machine you come across actually "
"gives back change — sometimes they don’t!  Throw in a 10 cent coin and press "
"the return button.  If it doesn’t give the coin back, you can move on to the "
"next machine; there’s a high chance it won't return higher denominations "
"either.  Next throw in a random 2 euro coin and press the return button. You "
"should do this because vending machines may not return 2 euro coins, but "
"rather 1 euro- or 50 cent coins instead.  It's better to find out immediately"
" rather than throwing in all of your 2 euro coins!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Stopper"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to be able to know when we’ve gone through all the coins in the "
"vending machine.  To do this, take out a coin and mark it with something "
"(drawing on it with a Sharpie works well), then put it into the machine. Next"
" time you get the same coin back, you know you’ve gone through everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rejected Stoppers and Coins"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes you may throw a stopper in, but you hear a ‘clunk’ sound, as if the"
" coin was dropped into a box (normally adding a coin should be silent after "
"you throw it in).  This means the coin was not added to the stack properly, "
"and so it will not be returned.  Pay attention to this noise, because you "
"won’t be getting the stopper back!  Throw in another marked coin instead "
"until the machine accepts the coin."

msgid "Merging"
msgstr ""

#, python-format
msgid ""
"The vending machine merges change together.  For example if you throw in 5 "
"%(fifty_cent)s coins, the machine returns either 2 %(one_euro)s and 1 "
"%(fifty_cent)s coin or 1 %(two_euro)s and 1 %(fifty_cent)s coin. This usually"
" means you can hunt 2 euro coins very quickly but other denominations only "
"one at a time.  A good tip is to throw in an odd number of euros and 80 cents"
" if you want to sort through all denominations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Non-Merging"
msgstr ""

#, python-format
msgid ""
"The vending machine does not merge change together. This means if you throw "
"in 5 %(fifty_cent)s coins it will return 5 %(fifty_cent)s coins. This makes "
"it very easy to hunt a large amount of a specific denomination."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limits"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are some limits to vending machine hunts which you need to be aware of."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maximum Input Limit"
msgstr ""

#, python-format
msgid ""
"The machine has a maximum amount you can throw in, and will reject anything "
"higher.  For example machines with a max limit of five euros will reject any "
"additional coins if you throw in five euros.  You can try to go above the "
"limit if you throw in, say, %(four_eighty)s and then another one- or two euro"
" coin; the machine will probably accept it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maximum Change Limit"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some machines will either give back large amounts of change in bills or will "
"not give back large amounts of change (usually cigarette machines). Read the "
"labels on all machines carefully since these limits are usually written "
"there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cigarette Machines"
msgstr ""

#, python-format
msgid ""
"In some countries where cigarette machines are legal, you can hunt through "
"them as well.  Unless you’re in Malta, you must verify your age on them by "
"either sliding an ID card through a sensor or holding a debit card on an RFID"
" scanner; you must do this for every cycle.  Sometimes you must also select "
"something to purchase, throw in less money than the cost, and then cancel the"
" purchase.  Note that most cigarette machines in Austria have a "
"%(four_ninty)s max change limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For RFID scanner machines it helps to wear a glove and slide a debit card "
"into the back of it so you can easily use both hands and don’t have to fumble"
