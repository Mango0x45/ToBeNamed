# British- and American English

The site supports both British English and American English as two seperate
language choices.  The main reason for this is because Americans will want their
dates with the month before the day while Europeans will want the day before the
month.  Since these two options exist though, the different dialectal
differences must be noted for translations.

English does not have a set language standard and most rules when it comes to
writing are up to the author, so here are the following rules that this site
will abide by based on what has been observed to be more prevelant in the
different regions.  In the following list, ‘en_GB’ refers to British English
while ‘en_US’ refers to American English.

- en_GB prefers single quotes while en_US prefers double quotes.  Always
  alternate between single- and double quotes when quotes are nested.

- en_GB prefers spellings with ‘s’, ‘æ’, ‘œ’, etc. while en_US prefers
  simplified spellings.

  - For example, ‘realised’ vs ‘realized’, ‘encyclopædia’ vs ‘encyclopedia’.
    ‘œstrogen’ vs ‘estrogen’.

- en_GB prefers no comma before ‘and’ while en_US prefers a comma before ‘and’.

  - For example, ‘Apples, Pears and Oranges’ vs ‘Apples, Pears, and Oranges’.

- en_GB prefers non-quotation punctuation outside of the quotes while en_US
  prefers it in the quotes.

  - For example, ‘he said “wow”.’ vs “he said ‘wow.’”
