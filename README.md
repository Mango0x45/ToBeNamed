## For Developers


### Initial Project Setup

To initially set everything up, you’re going to need the following:

- A relatively modern version of Python

- [Pipenv][1]

Once you’ve got those two, create a new Python virtual environment with
`pipenv` by running `pipenv shell` — and once that’s done — install the required
libraries with `pipenv install --dev`.

You should now be able to run the development environment with `python3
src/app.py`.
