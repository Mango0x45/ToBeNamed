# The Euro Cash Website (Domain Pending)

This is the git repository for the Euro Cash website (name- and domain
pending).  It aims to be a compendium of everything there is to know about euro
coins and -banknotes.  The site also aims to be inclusive to all Europeans, with
the eventual aim of supporting all major European languages, and to be fast and
responsive with simple-yet-effective CSS, minimal JavaScript, etc.

If you would like to contribute to the project with new information such as
mintage figures, coin designs, etc., but donâ€™t have the technical knowledge to
contribute directly to the site then feel free to reach out either by email
[here][1], or on discord to `@onetruemangoman`.

If you are a developer and would like to contribute, see the documentation in
the [`doc/`](doc/) folder.
